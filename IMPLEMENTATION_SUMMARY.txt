Implementation Summary - 3D Output Format Feature
================================================

Files Created:
--------------
1. src/3d-generator.ts - Core 3D generation logic
2. src/components/3d-dialog.tsx - UI dialog for 3D export

Files Modified:
--------------
1. src/types.tsx - Added ThreeDProps type and is3DOpen UI state
2. src/app.tsx - Added 3D button and dialog integration
3. src/firaga.tsx - Added default 3D settings

Features Implemented:
--------------------

1. 3MF Format Export:
   - Generates standard 3D Manufacturing Format files
   - Creates separate material shapes for each color
   - Each color gets its own mesh with proper material assignment
   - Uses cube primitives for each pixel
   - Outputs proper XML structure with materials and triangles
   - Packaged as ZIP file (3MF standard)

2. OpenSCAD Masks Export:
   - Generates one black/white PNG image per color
   - Creates OpenSCAD script that loads images as heightmaps
   - Uses linear_extrude to create 3D geometry from masks
   - Applies proper color to each layer
   - Packaged as ZIP file with images and .scad file

3. UI Components:
   - New toolbar button (📦 3D) between Print and Settings
   - Dialog similar to Print dialog with format selection
   - Dimension inputs for pixel height and base height
   - Shows current pitch from material size
   - Generates output on button click

Settings Available:
------------------
- Format: 3MF or OpenSCAD
- Pixel Height: Height of each colored pixel (default 2mm)
- Base Height: Height of base layer (default 1mm)
- Pitch: Automatically calculated from material size

Technical Details:
-----------------
- JSZip library loaded dynamically from CDN
- file-saver library used for downloads (already in dependencies)
- Proper TypeScript types throughout
- Integration with existing image processing pipeline
- Uses existing PartListImage data structure
